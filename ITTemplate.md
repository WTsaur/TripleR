#### Programming Languages (5 points)
- Python: along with python we are using flask for the API because of its lightweight structure and python is a language that is easier to understand amongst all. Pairing python database development is also easy to navigate. 
- Swift: XCode on MacOS. We use this for the front-end development of the TripleR app. We chose this language because a large portion of us were familiar with XCode and mobile app development on iOS. We all also have iOS devices to implement testing in later iterations.

#### Platforms, APIs, Databases, and other technologies used (5 points) 
- Azure Devops:  We use Azure for its server to host the API. It can be accessed from Microsoft Azure site.
- MongoDB: NoSql Database located on the MongoDb site.
- Flask: back-end development web framework for API. 
- XCode: front-end development and deployment in simulated iPhones. 
- iPhone: testing platform.
- Cocoapods: CheckboxList and EMTNeumorphicView
- EMTNeumorphicView is used on the Report, Rights, and Record button to apply a neumorphic design to the buttons
- CheckboxList will be used in the Report under the Description of Incident section to provide a checklist for actions that the officer took (identified themselves, use force, draw or use weapon, etc.)

#### Execution-based Functional Testing (10 points)
Describe how/if you performed functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the functional requirements listed in your RD). 
#### Execution-based Non-Functional Testing (10 points)
Describe how/if you performed non-functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the non-functional requirements listed in your RD). 
#### Non-Execution-based Testing (10 points)
Describe how/if you performed non-execution-based testing (such as code reviews/inspections/walkthroughs).
