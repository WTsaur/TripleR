## What is TripleR?
A police misconduct reporting platform iOS app for users to share their experiences and encounters with police by recording important details and evidence of these encounters in a secure, encrypted database. The goal of this app is to provide users a “Report” function that requests information essential to accurate local officer misconduct reports such as officer name, description, vehicle number, witness information, and event description so that a report can be filed more accurately in each community. There will also be a “Record” function that captures events like traffic stops on video or audio, depending on the user's needs. The record functionality is user dependent (user controls if and what the app is recording). Finally, we aim to provide a “Rights” page that lists users’ rights when they are stopped or in tense situations with police. As the scope of law changes drastically in different states, the primary focus will be national laws upheld in Florida as well as state specific law that may aid a person's speech when encountering an officer.
